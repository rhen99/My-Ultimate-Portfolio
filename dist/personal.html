              <h1>How I Got Here</h1>
              <p>My Web Development Journey</p>
            </div>
            <div class="body">
              <p>
                I first learned about Web Development on January of 2017 when my
                mother told me that there is this online program that teaches
                various skills for undergrads, and there's this one course that
                would suite me well given my physical condition, and my computer
                savviness. At this point I have no idea how to code, I remember
                first time looking at a simple input element, and being confused
                as to what is the meaning of what.
              </p>

              <p>
                The course itself was written, it was very basic it just
                basically introduces you to HTML5 and CSS3, and how they work.
                Now even though that course taught me so little it definitly
                gave me something I could call a skill that can get me
                somewhere, so I continued to scour the internet for more
                resources to learn from. It took me a year, and a half to have a
                great understanding of programming logic, and even then I still
                have a lot to learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I got enough confidence in my skills I tried applying for
                jobs on various websites only to either get ignored, or not
                qualify at this point I'm so stressed out, but I kept at it.
                After another year of just endless studying, and finding ways to
                earn a job my folks started telling me to try getting into other
                stuff, because web development maybe just isn't for me I kept
                turning them down, because I'm tired of learning a certain set
                of skills just to maybe qualify for a job. At some point because
                of getting so stressed I decided give learning, and finding a
                job a rest for a few months, but keep finding ways to earn even
                a little amount of money using my skills.
