                    Hello there, I'm Arhen (eyrhen) I'm an extremely introverted
                    guy. They say I'm very intelligent, but not really, I just
                    easily gets fascinated on certain things that interests me.
                    I wasn't able to go to school normally, because of my
                    physical condition I've been born with some sort of problem
                    with my legs. I can feel them, and use them, I just can't
                    stand properly. Despite that I keep on striving to reach
                    wherever it is I want to go, and achieve whatever it is that
                    I want.

                  <h1>How I Got Here</h1>
                  <p>My Web Development Journey</p>
                </div>
                <div class="body">
                  <p>
                    I first learned about Web Development on January of 2017
                    when my mother told me that there is this online program
                    that teaches various skills for undergrads, and there's this
                    one course that would suite me well given my physical
                    condition, and my computer savviness. At this point I have
                    no idea how to code, I remember first time looking at a
                    simple input element, and being confused as to what is the
                    meaning of what.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The course itself was written, it was very basic it just
                    basically introduces you to HTML5 and CSS3, and how they
                    work. Now even though that course taught me so little it
                    definitly gave me something I could call a skill that could
                    get me somewhere, so I continued to scour the internet for
                    more resources to learn from. It took me a year, and a half
                    to have a great understanding of programming logic, and even
                    then I still have a lot to learn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I got enough confidence in my skills I tried applying
                    for jobs on various websites only to either be ignored, or
                    not qualify. At this point I'm feeling really stuck, but I
                    kept at it. After another year of just endless studying, and
                    finding ways to earn a job my folks started telling me to
                    try getting into other stuff, because web development maybe
                    just isn't for me. I kept turning them down, because I felt
                    like the time, and effort I've put into learning all about
                    web development would just be wasted. At some point, because
                    of getting so stressed, and feeling stuck I decided give
                    learning, and finding a job a rest for a few months. I still
                    tried to find a way to get other types of jobs like content
                    writing, I even tried doing Youtube, but, because I don't
                    have the right setup it's pretty hard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After a while of trying to do other stuff, I decided to try
                    to pursue this passion of mine again, but try even harder
                    than before. I might get tired again, but I'm just gonna
                    bounce back and learn from what I've been doing wrong.
